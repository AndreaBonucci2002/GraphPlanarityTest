# GraphPlanarityTest
-Uses Euler's planarity formula to verify planarity for a graph.
-Euler's formula states that if a finite, connected, planar graph is drawn in the plane without any edge intersections, and v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges and f is the number of faces (regions bounded by edges, including the outer, infinitely large region), then v-e+f=2.
